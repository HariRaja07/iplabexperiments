    <h1>FOLDABLE SMARTPHONES</h1>
    <p>A <em>foldable smartphone</em> (also known as a foldable phone or simply foldable) is a smartphone with a folding form factor. It is a modern flip phone.[1][2] Some variants of the concept use multiple touchscreen panels on a hinge, while other designs utilise a flexible display. </p>
    <p>Concepts of such devices date back as early as Nokia's "Morph" concept in 2008, and a concept presented by Samsung Electronics in 2013 (as part of a larger set of concepts utilizing flexible OLED displays), while the first commercially available <em>folding smartphones with OLED displays</em> began to emerge in November 2018.</p>
