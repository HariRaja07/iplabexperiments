        <p>The BlackBerry KeyOne (stylized as BlackBerry KEYone, also known as BlackBerry Key 1, BlackBerry Key1) is a touchscreen-based Android smartphone with an integrated hardware keyboard that is manufactured by TCL Corporation under the brand name of BlackBerry Mobile. Originally known by its unofficial code name "Mercury",[1] the KEYone was officially announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on February 25, 2017.[2] While earlier BlackBerry smartphones running Android exist, the KeyOne is the first Android-based BlackBerry with the iconic BlackBerry design (having an integrated hardware keyboard fixed below the screen instead of having the keyboard on a slide like the Priv). TCL executives termed the KeyOne as a success, mentioning 850,000 units being sold.[3]</p>
